    "1. **Homogeneity:** All elements in an ndarray must be of the same data type.\n",
    "2. **Multidimensionality:** ndarrays can have any number of dimensions, from 0-dimensional (scalar) to n-dimensional.\n",
    "3. **Fixed Size:** The size of an ndarray is fixed after creation. Resizing an ndarray involves creating a new array and copying the data.\n",
    "4. **Efficient Memory Layout:** ndarrays are stored in contiguous memory blocks, which enables efficient memory access and arithmetic operations.\n",
    "5. **Vectorized Operations:** NumPy provides vectorized operations that allow you to perform operations on entire arrays without explicit loops, resulting in significant performance gains.\n",
